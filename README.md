# Hello, I'm Jed.
(they/he)

Salutations, @world. I am a form of creative technologist (read: human with a computer.)

I currently work on conceptual projects, helping bridge abstract creative to the technologies needed to develop, design and realise it to deliver the best experience.

I am an unqualified non-developer, getting by on a unique patchwork blend of languages, tools and techniques.

Physically located on Earth in London, UK
