### whois:"jed"
**hello, world**. My name is Jed (he/him)

My career work has been in roles between technology, media and brand -- I love integrating with teams and projects in spaces between design and development, and rapid prototyping.

I mainly play with front-end web technologies, but spend my time on Github trying to learn and experiment. I'm passionate about accessibility for all, next generation computer interfaces and democratised access to AI/ML technologies.

Previously studied business with marketing and organisation-work-and-technology at Lancaster University Management School.

Currently in London, UK (Earth).
